## slam
mainly my recreation of orb slam. I started this project to learn, not knowing anything about epipolar geometry or any sort of that stuff, now I know more. Follow along my route. Might write something at the end about monocular slam for people like me who know nothing about math.

- do orb2
- get homography
- we need a map
- then compute homography
- more stuff
- find bundle adjustment
